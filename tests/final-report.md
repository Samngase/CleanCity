## 🐞 Highlighted Defects

- ❗ No validation on empty phone number field in pickup form
- ❗ Feedback accepted for invalid/closed request IDs
- ⚠️ Dashboard filters partially reset when clicking "Reset"
- ⚠️ Long feedback messages overflow the UI card layout

---

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- No backend APIs limited testing of actual data persistence
- No authentication implemented, restricting role-based testing
- Manual entry of mock data for dashboard required repetitive reloads

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Add backend API integration to persist and verify request data
- Implement server-side input validation for robustness
- Improve feedback module’s ID verification and form clarity
- Apply strict HTML input attributes to prevent form misuse
- Add real-time updates or webhooks to reflect admin actions

## ✅ Conclusion

The CleanCity App meets most of its functional requirements and is visually responsive and user-friendly. With minor fixes to validation and data integrity, it can be considered production-ready.
