# üõ†Ô∏è Defect Management Plan ‚Äì CleanCity App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the strategy and workflow for managing defects identified during the testing of the CleanCity App. It ensures all defects are captured, tracked, and resolved effectively.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Identify and document defects consistently.
- Prioritize defects based on severity and impact.
- Assign responsibilities for defect resolution.
- Track defect status through resolution and verification.
- Ensure communication among QA, development, and stakeholders.

---

## 3. Defect Lifecycle

The defect lifecycle follows these stages:

1. **New** ‚Äì Defect is discovered and logged.
2. **Assigned** ‚Äì Assigned to the appropriate developer.
3. **In Progress** ‚Äì Developer has started investigating/fixing.
4. **Fixed** ‚Äì Developer resolves the issue.
5. **Ready for Retest** ‚Äì QA is notified to verify the fix.
6. **Retest Passed/Failed** ‚Äì QA validates fix; if failed, reopens defect.
7. **Closed** ‚Äì QA confirms issue is resolved and closes it.
8. **Deferred** ‚Äì Defect resolution postponed.
9. **Rejected** ‚Äì Issue is not a defect or not reproducible.

## 4. Severity & Priority Matrix

| Severity     | Description                                    | Example                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Critical     | Causes system crash or major data loss         | Dashboard filter returns incorrect results |
| High         | Key functionality broken or security flaw      | Missing form validation                    |
| Medium       | Affects usability or non-core functionality    | Invalid input accepted                     |
| Low          | Cosmetic or minor issues                       | Missing `alt` text in images               |

| Priority     | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| P1 (Urgent)  | Must be fixed immediately                    |
| P2 (High)    | Fix soon; affects key user journey           |
| P3 (Medium)  | Can be fixed after high-priority issues      |
| P4 (Low)     | Fix if time permits; low impact              |
